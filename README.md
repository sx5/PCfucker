- Information:
*This is a program that will keep shutting down PC on startup, once ran*
______________________________________________________________________
- How it works:

$ Will create a python file in Dekstop
$ Writes in the file a command code for shutdown
$ Compiles the python file into an executable
$ Moves the executable to startup folder
$ Deletes original python files with source code
$ Finally, it shuts down the computer, and it keeps shutting it down on startup
_______________________________________________________________________________
- FIX:
*If you ran it for testing purposes or for some other reason, you can fix this by booting in Safe Mode and deleting the program from the startup folder*
